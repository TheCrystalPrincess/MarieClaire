Perhaps it                                                    was because of his holiday house in Bisdary on the islands of                                                    Guadeloupe, or the stories found in great literature. What is known                                                I at this affinity with the deep blue sea and its marvelous creatures                                                    is th                                          provided him with a never-ending tide of inspiration.                                             Schlumberger started working at Tiffany \& Co. in 1956, where his surreal                                         marine designs – from gold mackerel with emerald eyes to sapphire-encrusted                                        anemones – caught the attention of many high-proﬁle clients, including Hollywood                                        stars Elizabeth Taylor and Audrey Hepburn. This year, Tiffany’s annual Blue Book                                         collection of high jewellery pays tribute to the timeless designs of Schlumberger.                                             Titled Out of the Blue, the ethereal, luminescent collection will be launched in                                          two phases throughout the remainder of 2023. The ﬁrst phase is the summer                                           collection, exploring seven aquatic themes.

The story begins in 1932, when                              pioneering divers wearing the Omega Marine                 watch ventured down into Switzerland’s Lake Geneva,                 reaching the record-breaking depth of 73 metres.                      Although not all who seek a quality wristwatch have                 underwater-oriented goals, a love of quality and design                 unites those who desire a luxury timepiece.

She spent many                     of her teen years blogging about her experience with                     autism under the pseudonym Princess Aspien and,                     to her surprise, thousands of people reached out in                     response, thanking her for making them feel that                     they weren’t alone.                         Today, the 26-year-old is once again paving                     the way for neurodivergent people all over the world                     with her Logie-award nominated portrayal of autistic                     character Quinni in Netﬂix’s Heartbreak High series                     reboot. The hit Australian show, which is shooting its                     second season, was lauded globally for its grittiness as                     well as its diversity and truthful representation. While                     previous depictions of autistic characters were mainly                     played stereotypically by neurotypical men, Hayden’s                     rendering is nuanced and authentic.                         As well as starring in Heartbreak High, the actor                     is the host of the new podcast Boldly Me, where she                     interviews high-proﬁle personalities about being their                     true, bold selves. Hayden is also the author of last year’s                     release Different, Not Less: A neurodivergent’s guide to                     embracing your true self and ﬁnding your happily ever                     after, which is a practical guide as well as a personal –                     and at times heartbreaking – account of what she went                     through as a child. In it, she tells of ﬁnding notes in her                     school locker telling her to kill herself. Once, she had a                     sleepover party and gave BFF necklaces to the girls who                     attended, only to discover they’d thrown them in the bin                     the next day, saying, “We’d never be friends with you.”                     Teachers told her she needed to “grow up” and gave her                     detention when she cried about not understanding                     her lessons.                         Fast-forward to now and Hayden’s life is a far                     cry from those dark days. In December last year, she                     and partner Dylan Rohan got engaged, with the star                     sharing the happy news on her social media accounts,                     which total about 1 million fans across TikTok and                     Instagram. The couple have just bought their ﬁrst                     home together.                         “Marriage means I get to spend forever with my                     best friend,” Hayden tells marie claire on the set of                     her cover shoot. Rohan, who is listening in, adds,                     “And build a future together.” They smile adoringly                     at each other.

It’s Australia,                         I’m doing this shit for free, so I                                                 that sort of stuff doesn’t happen to                         might as well get paid for it!” But              “The day after                    Australians.”  And then the day after                         as soon as I left the house, I was                                                 it came out, I was walking through                         nonverbal. I couldn’t speak to                  Heartbreak came                    Sydney and I got mobbed. And I was                         anyone. It wasn’t really an option           out, I was mobbed.                    like, “Oh, OK, this is big!” It was                         for me. My dad would joke that if                                                  a full Hannah Montana moment.                         I wanted to be a performer, I’d have           My world turned                     My whole world just turned around                         to mime. But performing was my                around overnight”                    literally overnight. It was crazy.                         biggest dream in the entire world.                                                 What would it have meant to you                         So despite the fact I couldn’t even                                                and your family to see a character                         walk in a straight line, let alone dance, and that I            like Quinni when you were diagnosed with                         froze up whenever I was asked to sing or speak in               autism at 13? It honestly would have changed                         front of people, my parents were like, “Well, this is           the whole trajectory of my life. You can’t be what                         her dream, so we’re gonna do whatever it takes to get           you can’t see. Growing up, never seeing myself                         there.” Every time I got kicked out of a dance class            represented, I grew up thinking I wasn’t supposed to                         for being too bad, my mum would say, “That’s ﬁne,               be here. In some ways, it’s the most overwhelmingly                         we’ll ﬁnd you another one.” We used to live in this             exciting thing to be able to be one of the ﬁrsts. Young                         tiny little town in the bottom of Victoria and my dad           people can look at Quinni and go, “OK, if she exists                         would drive me eight hours every week just to go to             as wholly and beautifully and unapologetically as                         an acting class. My dad is the best person in the               she does, then I can too.” But in other ways it’s                         whole world, I love him so much. When I was like,               devastating that it took us so long to get to this point.                         “I want to be a motivational speaker,” he was like,             I don’t think people understand just how much of an                         “OK, well, you’re going to speak to me ﬁrst.” So every          impact media has on the way we perceive reality.                         single night, my mum and dad would sit there and                Media chooses what our reality is. Probably weekly                         I’d stand up and read monologues to them. Despite               I will still get messages or comments in real life                         all odds, they made sure I was able to get to where             going, “You’re nothing like Sheldon Cooper [the                         I wanted to be. I owe everything to them.                       character in The Big Bang Theory].” It happens all                         What was your reaction when you were told                       the time. And it’s because this is what we believe                         you had the role of Quinni? When I got the role,                autism to be. Even when we see real versions of it                         I was doing a motivational talk in Albury-Wodonga.              in the news or whatever, it’s always done in a really                         At nine o’clock at night, I had 30 missed calls from            negative way. It’s “This person did this and, oh, by                         my agent. I got off stage at halftime intermission and          the way, they’re autistic.” So if I’d had a Quinni                         my PA was like, “Daniel’s calling you, I don’t know             growing up, not only would I have felt represented,                         what’s happening.” And I was like, “That’s so weird.            but my family, my teachers, my peers in school and                         It’s nine o’clock on a Friday night. What’s he doing            so many other people in my life would have gone,                         calling me?” So I step outside and I call him back              “OK, I understand what this is because I’ve seen                         and he doesn’t even say hello. The ﬁrst thing he says           it before,” rather than, “I think I understand what                         to me is, “Are you sitting down?” And as soon as he             this is because I’ve seen an incorrect stereotype.”                                                                                                                                                  marieclaire.com.au | 71","INTERVIEW                                                                                                     Aside from autism, you’ve openly spoken about                                                                                         being diagnosed with ADHD, endometriosis,                                                                                         adenomyosis and Postural Orthostatic                                                                                         Tachycardia Syndrome [POTS].

I don’t really have time to plan anything.                                                                                         My mum’s my low-key wedding planner.

Dylan had                            Rohan at marie claire’s                                      made this beautiful picnic down by the river and                               Women of the Year                            awards; and in a scene                                       halfway through I’m like, “Look, this is great but                            from Heartbreak High.

I was just like a little                                                                                         gremlin trying to get these tickets on our ﬁrst date.                                                                                         I got the best tickets you could and then I went,                                                                                         “Anyway, where were we?” [Laughs]                         In your book Different, Not Less, you wrote                     Speaking of One Direction, earlier this year                         about being viciously bullied as a child and how                you were at a Harry Styles concert in Melbourne                         much it affected you. Was it cathartic to write                 and stadium staff made you feel unwelcome                         about your experience? In some ways it was really               when you attempted to access Marvel Stadium’s                         beautiful. In other ways it was really, really difficult        sensory room. You met with the CEO of the                         because in order to make sure that my story was                 stadium to discuss how to ensure this didn’t                         being told and that other people were able to be                happen again.

My voice was taken away                         buried very deep and that I didn’t ever want to                 from me for so long, so I still struggle to remember                         bring up again. But I knew how important it was                 that I do have the ability and the power to incite                         to make sure that these stories were told. I have a             change. I mean, all of us do. But I think particularly                         philosophy that everything happens for a reason.                in circumstances like that, I forget that I don’t                PHOTOGRAPHY BY SIMON EELES/ART BOX BLACK; GETTY IMAGES.

PRODUCTION BY ROBYN FAY-PERKINS.                         My understanding of that is: I went through what I              have to be a victim. When Marvel said, “OK, we                         went through so another young girl doesn’t have to.             will build another sensory room; we’ll make sure                         Do you ever feel the weight of being a role model               more people can ﬁt in it and we’re not going to                         or representing an entire community of people?                  fact-check people,” I was like, “Wow.” I still feel                         Sometimes there’s deﬁnitely a pressure there. At                like I’m 16 years old and blogging in my bedroom                         times I get comments saying, “You don’t represent               as Princess Aspien.

There’s a long-held tradition in the              Greenblatt household. Whenever              Ariana lands a new role, a room in her              family home in Colorado is transformed              into the theme of the project. “When              I found out I had got the part in Greta              Gerwig’s Barbie, I came home from              school to the sound of Aqua’s “Barbie              Girl” playing,” she recalls. “Mom had              decorated the whole room in a Barbie              theme, complete with a pink cake.”                Taking on the role of Sasha in the              hotly anticipated fantasy comedy,              Ariana plays the human daughter of              Gloria (America Ferrera). “Going to              work every day on the set of Barbie’s              dream house was incredible,” says the              actor. “We’d blast ’90s music in the              morning and Michael Cera [who              plays Allan] and I would challenge each              other at Wordle. He’s a genius and beat              me every time. Margot [Robbie, who              plays Barbie] is like my older sister.              I still text her with updates on all              my high school gossip.”                Having a megastar on speed dial              might seem like it would secure you              bragging rights among your peers,              but hanging with Hollywood icons is              second nature to the teenager. Earlier              this year, Ariana starred alongside              Adam Driver in the ﬁlm 65, and with              Cate Blanchett and Kevin Hart in              Borderlands, out early next year.                With a hit ﬁlm under her belt, Ariana              has her sights set on a new goal this              year: gaining her driver licence. But              once she passes, a Barbie convertible              isn’t on her wish list. “My dream car              is a matte black Dodge Challenger              because my favourite singer of all time,              Billie Eilish, has one,” she says. “I want                                                                                                      GUTTER CREDIT              to follow in her lane.”","CULTURE                            A little bit                       ANNIE                          Schitt’s Creek star Annie Murphy                  dives into mermaids, deepfakes                  and comfort viewing                     It’s been three years since Schitt’s                 Creek wrapped. Where do you think                 your character Alexis would be now?                 Based on her past adventures, which                 are so expansive and colourful, she                 could literally be anywhere.                 If there were an opportunity for you                 to play Alexis again, would you?                 Of course I would! It was the most                 special time in my life. I had so much                 fun playing that character. The cast                 are all such dear friends. It would be                 a dream. But Alexis isn’t getting any                 younger. No-one wants to see a woman                 in her late sixties teetering around in                 high heels. I mean, of course there are                 women in their late sixties who can                 rock stilettos, but I won’t be one of                 them. So we need to get on with it                 if there’s going to be a reboot.

In         Things and [my character] Hopper ...                 stage right now in The Pillowman.               fact, a lot of my working relationships         they are things that we’ve done and                 Were you there on opening night?                have somewhat of a distance. And that’s         we’ve given them to you. And now you                 I wish. Her girls had to ﬁnish school.          conscious because I want the drama              have your own experience of them and                 And so I was with them in New York.             to be able to be as free and as real as         create your own world. It surprises me                 I did get to take one of them to a Taylor       possible. And I do feel like, with Lily,        how enormous it has become. But it                 Swift concert, which is pretty exciting         if something was very real in a scene,          does seem to have taken on a life of its                 for both of us! So I’ve been playing            it might hurt her feelings and I don’t          own that barely involves me anymore.                 single dad in New York.                         really want to do that.

He might wind up with Jessica Fletcher                 brings a certain energy to the people           The script reminded me a lot of this            in Murder, He Wrote or something –                 involved. In general, acting is about           movie I grew up with as a kid and I love        a show where he’s off solving crimes.                 conﬂict and drama. So some of that              so much: Hoosiers [from 1986]. It’s             I’ll pitch it to Netﬂix!                 energy has to be inherent to the                got that real classic sports feel to                 relationship.

My longtime clients can attest to my mantra that                 skin is a commitment. Technology and treatments have                 come a long way but getting the best results requires a                  pragmatic approach. I don’t push a “quick ﬁx”. Results                 are better when treatments are tailored for you.                   TH E G O O D A N D  BA D It’s no surprise that operating                 a business requires a lot of dedication, commitment and                 time. For me, it’s not just the hours I put into each clinic,                 it is also the additional upskilling, training, research and                 development that has to be done. As a single mum, I                 have to be realistic and allocate my time and energy fairly                  between the business and my ﬁve-year-old daughter.

Today he owns thriving Salon HER in                 Sydney’s Darlinghurst, where big names book in for                 natural-looking highlights, killer blowdries and                  (yes) cocktails.                 W H Y   H A I R D R E S S I N G  When I ﬁrst started in                 the industry I was, like most teenagers, a little                 misplaced at school. I knew I was creative and                 could talk under water, so hairdressing as a career                 path seemed ﬁtting. Quickly I realised that I                 possessed the natural talent and grit to achieve                 my goals. That belief in myself was what really                 catapulted me into the next 20 years of my industry                 growth and progression.                  B U S I N E S S  T I P One of the best decisions I made for                 Salon HER was not to launch the brand prematurely.                 I took my time to understand myself as a person ﬁrst                 and then as a leader to really make sure that business                 ownership was the right direction for me.

And              Twith that arises a slew of              concerns previously sorted by regular              salon visits (and a professional eye).              The good news: there are products               that can help. Effective formulas are              just a same-day-delivery away, but it’s              hard to know which ones will work.

CO N C E R N  # 1              U N RU LY   F R I Z Z               Hydration is key for combating frizz,              says Jaye Edwards. He suggests              applying products right after you              shower to lock in moisture; think               of it as “skin ﬂooding” for your hair.              While there are external aggressors that              contribute to frizz, it often comes down              to genetics, so “work with your natural              hair texture, rather than against it”. For              wavy to curly/kinky hair, products such              as Bread’s Curl Capturing Gloss gel are              essential in reducing frizz and taming              ﬂyaways while retaining texture and               volume.
